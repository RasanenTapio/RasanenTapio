### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a researcher and a Ph.D. student in economics. You can check my GitHub Pages [here](https://rasanentapio.github.io/) 

My research interests include family policies and their (sometimes unintended) effects. I analyze administrative register data, SQL, R and SAS in my everyday work.
